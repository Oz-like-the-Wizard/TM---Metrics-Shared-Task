# Text Mining - Metrics-Shared-Task

NOVA IMS - Text Mining - Final Project - Metrics Shared Task Repository

Project Description:

"""
For the following language pairs:
- Russian into English
- German into English
- Czech into English
- Chinese into English
- English into Chinese
- English into Finnish

For each translation you have the original segment, a reference translation (you gold truth) and
quality assessment reflecting “how good is a translation” in a scale of 0 to 100, given by 1 or
more human annotators. Those scores are then normalised to produce the z-score.

The goal of this project is to develop a metric that predicts the quality of a translation using the
reference. Your metric should correlate well with the existing quality assessments that you have
in the above corpus.
