# Text Mining - Metrics-Shared-Task

Text Mining - Final Project - Metrics Shared Task Repository

This project is created for the Text Mining course in NOVA Information Management School. The main objective of the project can be seen below. You can refer to main_nb for the work and proposed model.

Project Description:

"""
For the following language pairs:
- Russian into English
- German into English
- Czech into English
- Chinese into English
- English into Chinese
- English into Finnish

For each translation you have the original segment, a reference translation (you gold truth) and
quality assessment reflecting “how good is a translation” in a scale of 0 to 100, given by 1 or
more human annotators. Those scores are then normalised to produce the z-score.

The goal of this project is to develop a metric that predicts the quality of a translation using the
reference. Your metric should correlate well with the existing quality assessments that you have
in the above corpus.
